# Mental-Health-and-Screentime
This repository contains the code I contributed to a university coursework, where we were to investigate the link between mental health and screentime in adolescents. We were given a raw data file containing responses to a survey about the amount of time spent on screens at young ages (along with other factors). It also contained metrics used to indicate the mental health of the survey responders, such as 'Depression Score'. Our task was to use this data to investigate if there were any links to be found between mental health and time spent on screens. This repository contains code that was used to preprocess and clean the data, along with different analysis techniques including regression and correlation analysis.

Files:
- data_clean_nn.py. This Python script preprocesses the raw data file for machine learning & analysis by transforming categorical survey responses into numerical formats. It handles 'Yes/No' conversions, time intervals, education levels, occupational classes, and other survey-specific categories. The script checks for unexpected values, fills NaNs in specified columns, and outputs the cleaned, transformed dataset as a new CSV file.
- regressions_st_only_mode_imputed.ipynb. Notebook file where various correlation scores are calculated between target variables (mental health indicators) and feature variables (screen time metrics). Linear regressions are also calculated and measured using MSE and R^2.
